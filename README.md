# AutoTesterElectronics
This contains the Schematics and Board layout for the PCB for the autotester.  The autotester is a machine for automatically testing your water.

Info on the autotester can be found at https://robogardens.com/?p=928.

How you want to generate the PCB is up to you.  I use oshpark.com which requires simply uploading the .brd file.

A video showing the autotester in operation can be found at https://youtu.be/JWSlSH5BVns.
